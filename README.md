# Expo Starter Readme

Welcome to the Expo Starter template! This starter kit is designed to kickstart your mobile app development journey with various essential features pre-configured. Below is an overview of what's included and how to get started.

## Features Included

1. **Storybook**: Storybook provides a development environment for UI components, allowing you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components in isolation.

2. **Supabase Authentication**: Supabase authentication integration enables secure user authentication for your Expo app using Supabase, a robust open-source Firebase alternative.

3. **Theme**: The theme setup helps you maintain consistent styling throughout your app by defining and centralizing your design system's colors, typography, spacing, and more.

4. **i18n (Internationalization)**: i18n integration facilitates localization in your app, making it easy to support multiple languages and regions. Refer to [Expo Localization Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/localization/) for detailed guidance.

5. **App Router**: An app router is pre-configured to handle navigation within your Expo app efficiently.

6. **Tanstack Query**: Tanstack Query offers a powerful data fetching and caching library that simplifies API data fetching, caching, and synchronization in your app.
